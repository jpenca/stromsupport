<h2>Connecting&nbsp;STROM to your Elektron Analog Rytm</h2>
<h3>USB Connection</h3>
<p>To connect via USB, you need a Lightning to USB adapter. On your Rytm, please disable Overbridge mode (GLOBAL &gt; SYSTEM &gt; USB CONFIG &gt; USB-MIDI ONLY).</p>
<h3>Wireless Connection</h3>
<p>To connect STROM wirelessly, you need a Mac running the SDS Drop app. Connect your Rytm to your Mac via USB. Make sure that SDS Drop is running on your Mac, and that your iPad and Mac are both in the same local network. In SDS Drop, click on the STROM button and enable the remote connection from there.</p>
